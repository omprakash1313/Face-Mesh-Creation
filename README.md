468 Face Landmarks
In this project, I have worked on  how to detect 468 different landmarks on faces. I had used the model provided by google that runs in real-time on CPU and mobile devices.

# Finger Counter
In this project I had worked on  how to count fingers. We first look into hand tracking and then we will use the hand landmarks to count of the fingers. And all of this will be happening in real-time and requires close to no installations and configurations.
